. "game" contains examples on how to use the raylib-matte Game module, which is 
  more geared towards using raylib in practice. These examples, aside from 
  the full game example, are fully commented and use a recommended approach 
  to programming with raylib-matte.
  
. "raylib" contains translated examples from C from raylib. While functional,
  they do not show off the flexibility of Matte and use a more traditional
  non-object-oriented method of programming style.
  
. "raygui" contains translated examples from C from raygui. While functional,
  they do not show off the flexibility of Matte and use a more traditional
  non-object-oriented method of programming style.
